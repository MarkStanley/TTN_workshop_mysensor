# TTN_workshop_mysensor
Code to display temp, humidity and light from a Thing Innovations LoraWan sensor shield for Arduino - we use this in ourThins Network workshop

We just add everything here into the ttnreading.org/workshop folder and ta-da!

Note it uses Twitter bootstrap, jQuery , Sparkline.js and Justgage.js - all included in this repo.  Take care if you use different versions, Sparkline in particular is quite fussy!
